Kek is a programming language that is designed for 
fast, reliable, scalable, maintainable, secure, beautiful, simple,
marvellous and divine software.

It will replace JavaScript and Java and scripting and all 
other compiled languages. Obviously.

It transpiles to php, js and at some point in the future c.

It is very static. 

It is very wow.

## Main Features
- scope-based compiler rules
- assignment-conditionals
- local & const type modifiers
- traits
- struct and methods

## Zen of KEK

- Don't add a feature to the language if it is a function call.
- Don't add a feature to the language if it is a trait.
- Don't add a feature to the language if the feature is requested by bozos.
- Especially if you are the bozo.
- Static analysis is king, therefore less dynamic features are king.
- Set Your datastructures in perfect order before you criticize the language.
- Local is nice.
- Do the 20 for the 80.
- "Everything is a ..." is the root of all evil and leads to communism.
- Think long about naming stuff.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Don't abstract too early. There is a simpler concrete solution, you are 
  just too dumb to see it quiet yet.
